## Installation
### From Packages

For those that do not wish to compile the game on their own and use a binary right away, be aware of the following issues:

* Windows 7 is the minimum supported version.
* macOS users need to have macOS 11 (Big Sur) or higher to run ITGmania.
* Linux users should receive all they need from the package manager of their choice.

### From Source

ITGmania can be compiled using [CMake](http://www.cmake.org/). More information about using CMake can be found in both the `Build` directory and CMake's documentation.
