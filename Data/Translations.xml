You can define translations in this file to replace text in the song wheel.

   - Each translation entry is defined within a <Translation> tag.
   - The attributes TitleFrom, ArtistFrom, SubtitleFrom specify the original text to match.
   - The attributes TitleTo, ArtistTo, SubtitleTo specify the text to replace the matched text with.

To create your own translation value in the Translations.xml file, follow these steps:

1. Create a New Translation Entry:
   - Add a new <Translation> tag within the <Songs> section.
   - Define the TitleFrom, ArtistFrom, and/or SubtitleFrom attributes with the text you want to match.
   - Define the TitleTo, ArtistTo, and/or SubtitleTo attributes with the text you want to replace the matched text with.
   - All lines, by default, must match the entire line; for example, "Foo" matches only "Foo", not "Foobar".
   - Matches are case-insensitive.
   - Courses are matched by title only.

2. Use Regular Expressions:
   - The From attributes can use regular expressions to match patterns.
   - Ensure your regular expressions are correctly formatted and case-insensitive.
   - If all From lines for a set are matched, all To lines are replaced.

3. Example:
   - Here is an example of how to add a new translation entry:
   
<Translation TitleFrom="Old Title" TitleTo="New Title" />
   
   - If you want to match an artist as well:
   
<Translation TitleFrom="Old Title" ArtistFrom="Old Artist" TitleTo="New Title" ArtistTo="New Artist" />

4. Save and Apply Changes:
   - Save the Translations.xml file.
   - To apply the changes, delete the files in the "Cache" directory as mentioned in the comments of the XML file.

 --- Example ---

To add a translation for a song titled "Happy Song" by "John Doe" to be replaced with "Joyful Melody" by "Jane Doe":

<Translation TitleFrom="Happy Song" ArtistFrom="John Doe" TitleTo="Joyful Melody" ArtistTo="Jane Doe" />

or, to shorten the title of all songs from "In The Groove" to "ITG":

<Translation TitleFrom="((In The Groove)|(In the Groove))(.*)" TitleTo="ITG\${4}" />

Note that changes to this file are only applied to songs when they are first loaded.
Delete the files in the "Cache" directory after making changes.
